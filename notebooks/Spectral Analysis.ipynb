      "This is where we take the computed waterlevel run through script 3 and run methods in Fourier Analysis to determine the energy of the waves so that we can atnicipate possible damage from incoming storms.  This is not specific to environments on the East Coast, in both cases the water level will be shallow enought to apply our methods in linear wave theory."
